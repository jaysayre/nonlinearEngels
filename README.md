# nonlinearEngelcurves
Code (currently replication codes are available for both Python and Stata, R coming soon) to replicate the nonlinear price index and welfare estimation procedure in Atkin, Faber, Fally and Gonzalez-Navarro (2023).

### Inputs
Requires household consumption data that contains expenditures for households on goods g organized into groups G. Household consumption data can either be a repeated cross section or panel, but in either case must only contain two time periods. Households are ranked according to expenditures within a given market, which also must be provided. 

### Outputs
Smoothed expenditure and Engel curves, as well as a dataset containing welfare indices.
